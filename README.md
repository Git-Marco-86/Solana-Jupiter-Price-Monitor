# Solana Jupiter Price Monitor

A TUI (Text-based User Interface) written in Rust to monitor token prices and setting alerts on the Jupiter (Solana) platform.

### The Story

I built this little script for my own personal use a few months ago to keep an eye on some Solana tokens. This was a fun side-project to practice my Rust skills.

### 🚧 Current Status & How You Can Contribute

This project was a personal learning exercise. As such, the code is a snapshot of my progress and there are several areas for improvement. I'm publishing it to share my journey and I'm open to all feedback!

*   **Language:** The current UI output and all internal code comments are in **Italian**.
*   **Code Quality:** You'll find scattered `TODO:` comments and some commented-out code that needs refactoring. Cleaning this up is a key next step.
*   **Usage Instructions:** The `Usage` section below is very basic and could be expanded with more examples.

**This is one of my first projects shared publicly on GitHub.** If you try to run it and encounter any build issues (`cargo run` fails), please **open an Issue**! I'd be grateful for the bug report. Suggestions for improvement or Pull Requests are very welcome.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer: Maintenance Required!

This tool interacts directly with a web platform. As the platform's API or structure changes, this script will likely break. **It is provided as-is, and may require updates to function correctly.**

I'm publishing it as a portfolio piece to showcase my work in Rust. Feel free to fork it, learn from it, or submit a pull request if you update it!
