# Solana Jupiter Price Monitor
A command-line tool written in Rust for monitoring token prices and setting alerts on the Jupiter (Solana) platform. A personal side-project created to learn and practice Rust. Note: Provided as-is and may require maintenance to function.

---

### The Story

I built this little script for my own personal use a few months ago to keep an eye on some Solana tokens. This was a fun side-project to practice my Rust skills.

---

### ⚠️ Disclaimer: Maintenance Required!

This tool interacts directly with a web platform. As the platform's API or structure changes, this script will likely break. **It is provided as-is, and may require updates to function correctly.**

I'm publishing it as a portfolio piece to showcase my work in Rust. Feel free to fork it, learn from it, or submit a pull request if you update it!

### Usage

1. Clone the repository.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a token address and set your alerts.
